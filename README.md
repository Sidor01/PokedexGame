## Introduction
This project was a homework for my Object-Oriented C++ Programming course on the college. We had to make a simple game using C++ and Qt, in which we had to implement a few features of Object-Oriented Programming. I always loved Pokemon series, so I have chosen to make game based on it. Core of the game are Pokemons, each of which has separate statistics. It has a simple gameplay, where you pick your Pokemons that will be part of your team and then you pick your enemy. Every opponent has different Pokemons with different statistics. Then you move on to the fight screen itself. You can't control your allies. Pokemons fight on their own and you can only watch the process. There is also Pokedex, where you can check your favorite Pokemon's statistics, types and a short description.
